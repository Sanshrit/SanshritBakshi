# My Personal Portfolio Website

This Website is an easier way to understand my expertise, motivation and what I am passionate towards.
This project is programmed with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I Would be updating this portfolio to reflect my recent updates, key achievements and new projects. In the long term I intend to ramp up this website and use a more involved tech stack which gives me more flexibility and ability to add new features.
